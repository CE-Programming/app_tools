This is an extension to the CE C toolchain that generates application rather
than program files.

To use, replace the `include` statement for the CE C toolchain in your
project's makefile with path to the `makefile` file in this repository.

Running `make` will generate an installer program, as well as several 8xv
files containing the data for the app.
8ek files can be generated by running `make app`, however, they are not signed
and therefore cannot be sent to an unmodified calculator.
